/**
 * How the suite names a keyboard shortcut — Peek's `src/lib/shortcuts.ts`,
 * moved into the package with `SelectionToolbar`, whose tooltips use it (UIG-31).
 *
 * One place, because the app shows shortcuts in three: the top bar's search
 * field, the command launcher's footer, and the selection toolbar's tooltips.
 * They disagreed before this file existed — two of them hardcoded `⌘` and
 * showed a Mac glyph to somebody on Windows.
 *
 * **Words, not glyphs** (Katerina, 2026-09-05). Besides being wrong on the
 * other platform, `⌘` is not in Geist Mono, so it fell back to a system face
 * and sat oddly beside the letter next to it — `K` advances 6px in the chip's
 * own font, `⌘` 10.97px in the fallback.
 *
 * The shared `Kbd` renders what it is handed and formats nothing, by design:
 * only the app knows which platform it is looking at.
